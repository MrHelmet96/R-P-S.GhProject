# R-P-S.GhProject
This is my first JavaScript Project fot The Odin Project Curriculum. It consist on a Rock, Paper, Scissors machine.

In here I would try to update every relevant step of the process. That way I would be able to keep track of my mistakes and the things I learn in the process.
AT FIRST THERE WOULD BE NO HTML OR CSS, THE FUNCTIONALITY WILL BE SEEN AT THE CONSOLE.
